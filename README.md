#Asana
_find affordable yoga classes near you based on your time availability_.

####Overview
**Asana** is a project that started as a way to facilitate yoga practices in places like New York City where there is a high demand of yoga studios and a large community of very busy people that want to practice but have a hard time finding classes that fits their schedule and budget. As a yogi myself I have realized that many studios in the city offer donation based community classes a couple times a week at very different hours. So I thought why not create a place where people can access information form several studios, that way they might realize they have classes that work for them closer than they expected.

The site is designed for users as well as for studios. The idea behind it is to have yoga studios create their own accounts and post their classes on the site, when a user's search fit the criteria then the class gets added to the user's schedule.
